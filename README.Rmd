The `pokedex` package provides an R interface to search through the [pokedex_data] for names of Pokemon that have a specific Type. You can also display the official image of a Pokemon you would like to look up.

## Installation

You can install the development version of pokedex from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pokedex")
devtools::install_github("RISAW1130/pokedex")
```

## Usage

```{r example}
library(pokedex)
```

Given a specific name of a Pokemon, the `pokemon_photo()` function displays the corresponding official PNG image of the specified Pokemon in the R plot window:

```{r}
pokemon_photo("Pikachu")
```
